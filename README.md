The goal of our project is to allow users to select their starting and ending points within Macedonia, after which they will be given a suggested route using openstreetmap's API.<br>
Aside from the route, the users shall be given the total price they will need to spend on tolls (in their preferred curency), as well as suggested payment methods.

The data folder contains all the data used for this project, gathered from OSM and the website roads.org.mk<br>
